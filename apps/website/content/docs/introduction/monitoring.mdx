<Callout>
  The monitoring stack used here is a combination of various tools provided by
  [MykalMachon](https://github.com/MykalMachon) in the
  [repository](https://github.com/MykalMachon/railway-grafana-stack).

<Callout type="warn">
  Note that the services in this setup are not additionally secured, as they are
  not exposed and only operate within your own network. If you plan to expose
  these services, it is important to secure them (e.g., using a reverse proxy)
  to prevent unauthorized access or file manipulation by third parties.

## Loki

A log aggregation system developed by Grafana Labs, designed to collect, store, and query logs. Unlike traditional log systems, Loki indexes only metadata, making it efficient and cost-effective.

### General

The following custom attributes are always sent with each log entry to ensure proper structure and filtering.

| Attribute     | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project`     | The name of the project or application (e.g., `my-app`)        |
| `environment` | The environment context (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`) |
| `service`     | The specific microservice or component (e.g., `auth-service`)  |
| `version`     | The deployed version of the service (e.g., `v1.2.3`)           |
