## Loki

A log aggregation system developed by Grafana Labs, designed to collect, store, and query logs. Unlike traditional log systems, Loki indexes only metadata, making it efficient and cost-effective.

### General

The following custom attributes are always sent with each log entry to ensure proper structure and filtering.

| Attribute     | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project`     | The name of the project or application (e.g., `my-app`)        |
| `environment` | The environment context (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`) |
| `service`     | The specific microservice or component (e.g., `auth-service`)  |
| `version`     | The deployed version of the service (e.g., `v1.2.3`)           |
