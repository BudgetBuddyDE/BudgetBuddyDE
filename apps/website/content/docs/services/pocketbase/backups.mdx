title: Backups
---

In the admin interface of Pocketbase there is the possibility to create backups. This function is very useful to prevent data loss and ensure the integrity of the data. The backups are saved in the form of ZIP files and contain all information about the current status of the instance, including the database and configurations of the instance.
In addition, backups can be scheduled automatically and performed regularly to ensure that an up-to-date copy of the data is always available.
The backups are either stored locally or can be automatically stored in the cloud (support for AWS S3) and downloaded directly from there.

Pocketbase also provides an API to create and download backups. This API can be used in scripts or automations to create and save backups on a regular basis.
More information on the interface can be found in the [Pocketbase documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-backups/).
