## Self-Hosted (Docker Compose)

You can easily host the backend services (Auth Service, Backend, Database, Cache) yourself using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Configuration

Use the `docker-compose.yml` from the repository.

### Running the Stack

1. Start the services:
   ```bash
   # Start services in detached mode
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. The services (and databases) will be available at:
   - **Auth Service**: `http://localhost:8080`
   - **Backend**: `http://localhost:9000`

<Callout type="warn">
  The Webapp is currently not included in this Docker Compose setup. You can deploy it separately (e.g., on Vercel) or build a Docker image for it manually.
</Callout>

## Railway

import RailwayDeployment from "../../../src/components/RailwayDeployment";

<RailwayDeployment />

### Instance configuration

It is possible to configure the runtime of a service in the Railway cloud using `railway.json` files. These are located in the directory of a service or an app.
The Railway documentation offers some help regarding the possible configuration options...
