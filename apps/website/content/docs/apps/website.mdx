### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TEMPO_URL` | Ingest URL for the Tempo tracing service | `http://tempo:4318` |
| `NEXT_OTEL_VERBOSE` | Enable verbose OpenTelemetry tracing | `undefined` |

<Callout type="info" title="Logs & Traces">
  The environment variable `TEMPO_URL` is only required if the server is started with tracing functionality.
  Next.js traces more spans than are emitted by default. To see more spans, you must set `NEXT_OTEL_VERBOSE=1`.
