## Database migration

> [!TIP]
> For more information about the schema generation and migration have a look into [the documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/basic-usage#migrate-database).

The database schema required for the Better-Auth auth service can be generated using the @better-auth/cli:

```bash
npm run ba:schema-generate
```

The previously generated schema can be applied using Drizzle Kit. This can be done with the following commands:

> [!WARNUNG]
> Make sure that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set and points to the target database where the schema should be applied. If the environment variable is not set, the process will fail with an error.

```bash
npm run db:generate # will generate all required schemas
npm run db:migrate
```
