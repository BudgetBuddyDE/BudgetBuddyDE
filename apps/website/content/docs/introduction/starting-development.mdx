## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:BudgetBuddyDE/BudgetBuddyDE.git
   cd BudgetBuddyDE
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build packages**

   This project uses a monorepo structure. You need to build the shared packages first.

   ```bash
   npm run build-packages
   ```

## Running the Project

Since this is a monorepo, you typically run the services and applications you are working on individually.

### 1. Setup Services

Both the **Auth Service** and **Backend** require environment variables and database setups.

- **Auth Service**: Follow the [setup instructions](./../services/auth-service) to configure the environment and run database migrations.
- **Backend**: Follow the [setup instructions](./../services/backend) to configure the environment and run database migrations.

### 2. Start Services

Navigate to the service directories and start them:

**Auth Service:**
```bash
cd services/auth-service
npm run watch
```

**Backend:**
```bash
cd services/backend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Start the Webapp

Once the services are running, you can start the web application:

```bash
cd apps/webapp
npm run dev
```

The webapp should now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
