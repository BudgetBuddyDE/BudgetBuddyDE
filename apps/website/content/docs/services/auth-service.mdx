title: Auth Service
---

## About

The Auth Service is a central component of the architecture that is responsible for user authentication and authorization. It enables users to register, log in, and determine their access to data.
The service was developed using the Better-Auth and ExpressJS frameworks and uses a PostgreSQL database to store user data. Thanks to the Better-Auth client library, it is easy to integrate a client into a frontend and backend.
Currently, the Auth Service supports authentication via email and password, as well as OAuth providers such as Google and GitHub.

<Callout>
  Other providers such as Apple and Microsoft are not currently planned, but can be configured if
  required.
</Callout>

## Getting started

### Development

<Steps>
<Step>
#### Clone the repository
    
```bash
git clone git@github.com:budgetbuddyde/budgetbuddyde.git
cd ./services/auth-service
```

</Step>
<Step>
#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

</Step>
<Step>
#### Set up environment variables
    
Set all required environment variables as defined in the `.env.example` file. You can copy the example file to create your own `.env` file.
</Step>
<Step>
#### Start the application

```bash
npm run watch
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Build

### Local

To build the service locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

### For Docker

<Callout type="info">
  A current Docker image is automatically created when a commit is pushed to the `main` branch. The
  image is provided in the GitHub Container Registry under
  `ghcr.io/budgetbuddyde/auth-service:latest`.
</Callout>

To build the service for Docker, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/budgetbuddyde/auth-service:latest .
```

## Deployment

The service is currently provided automatically as soon as a commit is pushed to the `main` branch. The service is run in a Docker container and provided in a Railway environment.

### Schema Migration

<Callout type="info">
  For more information about the schema generation and migration have a look into [the
  documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/basic-usage#migrate-database).
</Callout>

The database schema required for the Better-Auth auth service can be generated using the `@better-auth/cli`:

```bash
npm run ba:schema-generate
```

The previously generated schema can be applied using Drizzle Kit. This can be done with the following commands:

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set and points to the target database
  where the schema should be applied. If the environment variable is not set, the process will fail
  with an error.
</Callout>

```bash
npm run db:generate # will generate all required schemas
npm run db:migrate # will apply the generated schema to the database
```
