### What is a Log?

> "A recording of an event."<br/ >
> ~ https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/ @ 23.12.2025

An event that occurred at a specific point in time.

### What is a Metric?

> "A measurement captured at runtime."<br/ >
> ~ https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/ @ 23.12.2025

### What is Baggage?

> "Contextual information that is passed between signals."<br/ >
