A flexible and efficient JavaScript/TypeScript logging library with modular transport system, built-in batching, and debouncing capabilities for high-performance applications.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Logger, Transport Manager, and pluggable transport system
- **Multiple Transports**: Send logs to console, files, HTTP endpoints, or custom destinations
- **Built-in Batching**: Reduce overhead by grouping logs before transmission
- **Debouncing**: Optimizes performance during high-frequency logging
- **Child Loggers**: Create scoped loggers that inherit parent configuration
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed with comprehensive type definitions
- **Configurable Log Levels**: Filter logs by severity (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)

## Installation

```bash
npm install @budgetbuddyde/logger
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { LogLevel, createLogger } from '@budgetbuddyde/logger';

const logger = createLogger({
  label: 'MyApp',
  level: LogLevel.INFO,
});

logger.info('Application started');
logger.warn('This is a warning');
logger.error('An error occurred');
```

### Child Loggers

Create scoped loggers that inherit parent configuration:

```typescript
const childLogger = logger.child({
  label: 'Database',
  level: LogLevel.DEBUG,
});

childLogger.debug('Database connection established');
```

### Multiple Transports

Send logs to multiple destinations with different configurations:

```typescript
import { LogLevel, createLogger, Transport, type LogEntry } from '@budgetbuddyde/logger';

class FileTransport extends Transport {
  protected sendBatch(logs: LogEntry[]): void {
    logs.forEach((log) => console.log(`[FILE] ${log.message}`));
  }
}

const logger = createLogger({
  label: 'MultiTransportApp',
  level: LogLevel.INFO,
  transports: [
    new FileTransport({
      label: 'file',
      batchSize: 10,
      debounceMs: 1000,
      level: LogLevel.WARN, // Only warnings and errors to file
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Transport System

The transport system handles efficient log transmission with built-in optimizations:

- **Batching**: Groups logs to reduce transmission overhead
- **Debouncing**: Delays transmission to avoid overwhelming receivers
- **Level Filtering**: Processes only logs meeting minimum severity
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically re-queues failed logs for retry

## Custom Transports

> [!TIP]
> Inside the `examples` folder, you can find some custom transport implementations.

Create custom transports by extending the `Transport` base class:

```typescript
import { Transport, type LogEntry, type TransportOptions } from '@budgetbuddyde/logger';
```

## Publishing

The package is published automatically when changes are made to the `main` branch. Publishing takes place via Concourse CI within the [bb-logger](https://ci.tools.tklein.it/teams/main/pipelines/bb-logger?group=all) workflow.
