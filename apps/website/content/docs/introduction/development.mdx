## Accessing the local database

<Callout type="info">
In order to enable access to the local databases, I use [Drizzle Gateway](https://gateway.drizzle.team/). This tool allows me to access the databases locally while using the same environment variables as in the production environment.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Run the Docker Compose setup

```bash
docker compose up -d
# or just specific services
docker compose up -d drizzle_db_gateway auth_db backend_db
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Access the web interface

After starting the services, you can access the Drizzle Gateway web interface at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Use the following credentials to log in: `your_master_password`
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure database connections
In the Drizzle Gateway interface, you can set up connections to your local databases using the defined environment variables `AUTH_DB_URL` and `BACKEND_DB_URL`.
When adding an PostgreSQL connection just choose `Connection Url` and select the according environment variable.
After providing a name for the comnnection, you can save it and start using it to access your local databases.
