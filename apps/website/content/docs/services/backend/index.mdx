<Callout title="Attention">
  A new backend is currently under development to replace Pocketbase and the other individual
  services. The new backend will retain the old functionality while extending existing features.
  This will significantly increase the speed of development, as (among other things) changes to one
  interface will no longer require changes to multiple services.
</Callout>

## Introduction

The backend serves as the central backbone of the application, handling all data-related operations. Its responsibilities include:

- Managing and processing data
- Fetching and preparing external data sources
- Handling authentication and authorization
- Managing and sending newsletters

The backend is built with ExpressJS, and Better-Auth is used for authentication and authorization. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and cached with Redis. Database schema management is handled using DrizzleORM, while Resend is used to deliver newsletters.
