title: Backend
---

## About

The backend was developed using the SAP Capire Framework and PostgreSQL for persistence, enabling the frontend application to access and manage data. It provides a RESTful API in OData format, which allows data to be created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD operations). The backend has a modular structure and can be easily expanded to add additional functions.
Data security was ensured with restriction rules and the Auth service, which is responsible for user authentication and authorization, ensuring that each user can only access their own data.

## Getting started

### Development

<Steps>
<Step>
#### Clone the repository
    
```bash
git clone git@github.com:budgetbuddyde/budgetbuddyde.git
cd ./services/auth-service
```

</Step>
<Step>
#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

</Step>
<Step>
#### Set up environment variables
    
Set all required environment variables as defined in the `.env.example` file. You can copy the example file to create your own `.env` file.
</Step>
<Step>
#### Start the application

```bash
npm run watch
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Build

### For Docker

<Callout type="info">
  A current Docker image is automatically created when a commit is pushed to the `main` branch. The
  image is provided in the GitHub Container Registry under `ghcr.io/budgetbuddyde/backend:latest`.
</Callout>

To build the service for Docker, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg DB_HOST=mein-db-host \
  --build-arg DB_PORT=5432 \
  --build-arg DB_USER=meinuser \
  --build-arg DB_PASSWORD=geheim \
  --build-arg DB_DATABASE=meinedb \
  -t ghcr.io/budgetbuddyde/backend:latest .
```

## Deployment

The service is currently provided automatically as soon as a commit is pushed to the `main` branch. The service is run in a Docker container and provided in a Railway environment.

### Schema Migration

Information about the restrictions that apply to automatic schema evolution can be found in the [SAP Capire documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/databases-postgres#schema-evolution).

## Security

<Callout>
  The backend is secured by the Auth Service, which ensures that only authenticated users can access
  the data (by using `@(restrict: [])`; [SAP Capire
  documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/security/authorization#restrictions)).
</Callout>

The middleware for authentication was implemented in `srv/auth.ts`. For testing purposes, authentication is mocked and a user is set in `srv/mocked-test.ts`.
