## Overview

The Auth Service is based on Express.js and TypeScript. The authentication logic was implemented using the [Better-Auth](https://better-auth.com/) library. This allows the service to be connected to other OAuth2 and OpenID Connect compatible identity providers with little effort. Additionally, there is the possibility to install plugins to use further features such as Two-Factor Authentication.
Currently, users can log in and authenticate using an Email/Password combination or via a Github or Google account.

### Features

- **Login and Registration** of users using Email/Password combination
- **Login and Registration** of users via OAuth2 (Google, Github)
- **Management of user sessions** (as well as creating sessions on multiple devices)
- **Password reset** via Email
- **Email verification** after registration

### API Documentation

The documentation of [Better-Auth](https://better-auth.com/) can be viewed [here](https://better-auth.com/docs/).

| Method | Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GET | `/health` | Health Check Endpoint |

## Development

**Start service locally**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start in development mode
npm run dev
```

**Linting & Formatting**

```bash
# Check linter
npm run check

# Automatically fix linter errors
npm run check:write

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Connection string to the database | - |
| `REDIS_URL` | Connection string for Redis cache | - |
| `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of trusted origins for CORS | - |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Random string to secure authentication | - |
| `BASE_URL` | Host URL of the service to e.g. generate links in emails correctly | - |
| `BACKEND_HOST_URL` | Host URL under which the backend is reachable | - |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API to send emails via Resend | - |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Log level for the application | `INFO` |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth Client ID | - |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth Client Secret | - |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth Client ID | - |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth Client Secret | - |
| `PORT` | Port on which the service runs | `8080` |

#### OAuth

The callback URLs for the OAuth providers must be configured as follows:

**Local**

```
http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback/<PROVIDER> # e.g. google, github
```

**Production Environment**

```
https://auth.service/api/auth/callback/<PROVIDER> # e.g. google, github
```

### Database Migrations

<Callout type="info">
  The environment variable `DATABASE_URL` must be set for migrations to be executed.
</Callout>

Database migrations are managed using Drizzle Kit. To create a new migration (for the database), the following command can be used:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

Using the following command, the migrations can be applied to the database:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

## Deployment

The service is automatically deployed via a Railway CI/CD pipeline on every push to the `main` branch.
Additionally, there is a [Concourse Workflow](https://ci.tklein.it/teams/budgetbuddyde/pipelines/auth-service), which tests the service on every push and builds and publishes a Docker image.

### Docker

The service can be containerized and deployed using the Dockerfile in the repository.
The following command can be used for this:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/budgetbuddyde/backend:latest
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --env-file ./path/to/env/file ghcr.io/budgetbuddyde/backend:latest
```

Additionally, a `docker-compose.yml` file is available in the repository, which can be used to start the service locally together with a PostgreSQL and Redis instance.
