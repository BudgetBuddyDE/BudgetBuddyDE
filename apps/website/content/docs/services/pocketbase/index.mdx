Pocketbase is an open-source backend solution that provides a NoSQL database, real-time APIs, and authentication mechanisms in a compact package. It is particularly useful for rapid prototyping, MVPs, and small to medium-sized applications.

We use Pocketbase to provide a robust and scalable backend infrastructure that can easily integrate into our existing applications. With Pocketbase, we can quickly create data models, authenticate users, and implement real-time updates without having to worry about the complex details of backend development.
